<h2>The Implementation</h2>
<h3>The source code structure</h3>
<p>The src folder contains main.cpp, twiddle.cpp, and three folders: . tune: contains twiddle implementation files. . control: contains the <a class="el" href="classPID.html">PID</a> control class . utils: contains the <a class="el" href="classReducer.html">Reducer</a> class</p>
<h5>File names</h5>
<p>In this project, I made a class to have its own .h, and .cpp files. More specifically, a class source file contains exactly one class, and has the same name as the class it contains.</p>
<h4>The libs folder</h4>
<p>The libs folder contains Eigen, <a class="el" href="json_8hpp.html">json.hpp</a>, and matplotlibcpp.h.</p>
<h2>Twiddle class</h2>
<p>The class implements twiddle algorithm in <b>twiddle()</b> method. Its subclass is required to implement the model simulation in the <b>run()</b> method.</p>
<h2>CarTwiddle class</h2>
<p>This class implements a simple vehicle motion model that simulates the coordinate and yaw of a vehicle from the steering, velocity, acceleration and delta time. It is a subclass of Twiddle, and implements the <b>run()</b> method. The motion model is implements in <b>move()</b> method.</p>
<h2><a class="el" href="classPID.html">PID</a> class</h2>
<p>This class implements <a class="el" href="classPID.html">PID</a> controller. The <b>updateError()</b> is used to update the error, then the control value can be obtained from <b>getControl()</b> method. In addition to updating error, one can also update the value using <b>updateValue()</b> method, and the error will be computed from the target that can be set using <b>setTarget()</b> method.</p>
<h2><a class="el" href="classReducer.html">Reducer</a> class</h2>
<p>This class provides aggregation for a set of samples. This includes mean, weighted mean, sum, max, and min.</p>
<h2>Determine <a class="el" href="classPID.html">PID</a> coefficients</h2>
<p>Two <a class="el" href="classPID.html">PID</a> controllers are used in this project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Steering <a class="el" href="classPID.html">PID</a> controller: for controlling the steering so the car is driven as closed to the center as possible.</li>
<li>Acceleration <a class="el" href="classPID.html">PID</a> control: for controlling the acceleration and deceleration of vehicle. The project aimed to make the vehicle fast and furious. It decides the desirable speed according to the steering angle. Then the PIC controller is used to obtain the acceleration or deceleration.</li>
</ul>
<p>The twiddle program was used to help to narrow down the range of <a class="el" href="classPID.html">PID</a> coefficients to reduce the efforts of finding optimal coefficients.</p>
<p>For the acceleration <a class="el" href="classPID.html">PID</a> coefficients, the values produced by twiddle are used without further tuning. They seem working fine for the purpose.</p>
<p>The steering <a class="el" href="classPID.html">PID</a> coefficients, on the other hand, required a lot of tuning efforts to reduce oscillation, and produce reasonable controller outputs.</p>
<p>The convergence diagram of different <a class="el" href="classPID.html">PID</a> coefficients are shown in <a href="./convergence.png">this diagram</a>. The tuning process started with the coefficients returned from twiddle as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>If the vehicle has difficulties to stay on the road at turns, increase k<sub>p</sub>.</li>
<li>Otherwise, if the vehicle oscillates a lot, reduce k<sub>p</sub></li>
<li>Fine tune k<sub>d</sub>, if the vehicle shows lots of sharp movements, reduce the value, otherwise, increase the value if this yield better motion.</li>
</ol>
<p>The default <a class="el" href="classPID.html">PID</a> coefficients that are chosen for this project are:</p>
<p>k<sub>p</sub> = 0.108, k<sub>d</sub> = 3.52, and k<sub>i</sub> = 0 for steering</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>k<sub>p</sub> = 13.5795, k<sub>d</sub>= -11.4359, and k<sub>i</sub> = 0 for aceleration.</p>
<p>The k<sub>i</sub> in both controllers are 0 as no drift was assumed, and they seem fine with the simulator. Should a small amount of drift be applied for the acceleration <a class="el" href="classPID.html">PID</a>? I think it will depend on the road condition, so I decided to not to consider it.</p>
<h2>Steering</h2>
<p>The CTE values reported the simulator are updated to the steering <a class="el" href="classPID.html">PID</a> controller. The steering control value is then obtained from the <a class="el" href="classPID.html">PID</a> controller, then normalized to [-1 1] range.</p>
<p>The simulation shows large oscillation on curved road due to the following reasons:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The <a class="el" href="classPID.html">PID</a> process</li>
<li>When the vehicle is moved back to the center of the road, 0 steering will be sent back to the simulator. However, this should not be the case for curved road. Instead, the vehicle should be steered according to the curvature. This, unfortunately, cannot be obtained from the feedbacks provided by the simulator.</li>
</ol>
<p>To reduce oscillation, I have tried two approaches:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Use moving average of the steering control values to smooth out steering</li>
<li>Based on the thought that while it might not be very difficult to reduce the cummulated CTE after fine tuning <a class="el" href="classPID.html">PID</a> coefficients, why not try to replace sharp spikes in CTE with fewer but wider CTE peaks? This means that we let CTE to stay longer so the vehicle will oscillate less.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Moving average</h3>
<p>In this approach, every steering control values generated by the <a class="el" href="classPID.html">PID</a> controllerto a reducer, and let the reducer compute weighted average of the values within a kernel of some certain size (5 currently).</p>
<h3>Reduce CTE Spikes</h3>
<p>Could we reduce CTE spikes by widen it so the car will oscillate less while still can manage to stay on the road? On approach that I have tried is to remove some portion of steering as follows:</p><ol type="1">
<li>Take the moving average of the past 20 to 40 angles or turns (30 in my case).</li>
<li>Take the moving average of the past 3 to 7 steerings (5 in my case), and substract it with the moving average from 1. This effectively applies two different filters on the steering, one low pass, and another high pass.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Throttling</h2>
<p>The vehicle speed is set according to the steering angle, the bigger the angle, the slower the speed should be for the vehicle to stay on the course. The <b><a class="el" href="utils_8cpp.html#afcea9d04c1a1c558749023bd1fcfd8d2">computeSpeedTarget()</a></b> function computes the fastest possible speed for the vehicle.</p>
<p>The difference between the target speed and the current speed reading is fed into the acceleration <a class="el" href="classPID.html">PID</a> controller. The output of the controller is the acceleration or deceleration for the vehicle.</p>
<p>The acceleration/deceleration is clamped to range [-20, 8], and then converted to a throttle value by the <b>computeThrottl()</b> function.</p>
<p>For acceleration, a minimal throttle value is required to keep the vehicle at the given speed, and extra throttle that is required to accelerate the vehicle is added.</p>
<p>For deceleration, the throttle will be set to a negative value, that is to brake the vehicle.</p>
<p>It also needs to be noted that the algorithm for computing the throttle from acceleration or deceleration is purely empirical. This is just like real world driving where we, at least for most people, will not know how fast the velicle will accelerate or decelerate when we step on the pedal or brake. We simply do until we have reached the target, and we step harder when we need things to happen faster.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The following table shows the simulation result with different steering algorithms, including the videos recording during the simulations, the charts that show the curves of the speed, original steering, adjusted steering, mean, and CTE of the vehicle from the starting point to the bridge. The tuned steering <a class="el" href="classPID.html">PID</a> coefficients used for each algorithm are also shown.</p>

</table>
<p>From the chart, we can observe the followings:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Moving average along did not reduce but increased the oscillation</li>
<li>By comparing the CTE curves on the charts, oscillation reduction using moving average did have reduced the oscillation, and was able to achieve a higher speed (up to <b>89Mph</b> has been observed).</li>
<li>Mean angle performed better than mean turn which had resulted in larger CTE.</li>
<li>Also observed in my experiments, oscillation reduction without using mean steering, and clamping changes in steering value may cause the vehicle to oscillate more.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>The above algorithms require different <a class="el" href="classPID.html">PID</a> coefficients to reach certain stability. This, of course, might affect the characteristics of the performance curve shown in the above charts. But for being able to run the simulator at a higher speed with reduced oscillation, I think I have achieved the goal.</p>
<p>The extra works that I have done to stabilize the vehicle was to due a challenge from one of my friend in that, with <a class="el" href="classPID.html">PID</a> alone, it looked like the driver was drunk! I think the driver is less drunk with the oscillation reduction apparoch, or maybe just for fun! </p>
